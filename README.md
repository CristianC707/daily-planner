DESCRIPTION: This assignment had me update a daily planner using jquery, local storage and other methods learned in class. I started by creating a function and using momentjs to display the time. Then I plugged in the css and js files that were given to me to update the styling and layout. I then created a column for my time slots and added an input to add value to the center container. Then, according to the time of day, I color coded the hours to reflect the time of day. Grey for past hours, red for current hour, and green for future hours. I also used local storage to save any data put into the schedule and had it pulled from local storage to show saved data.
